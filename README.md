## 💡 The Problem

You have 47 tasks on your to-do list. You're overwhelmed. You don't know where to start. By the end of the day, you've checked off 3 random items and feel unproductive.

**Sound familiar?**

---

## ✨ The Solution

**Signal vs. Noise** forces you to ask one question every morning:

> **"What are the 3-5 things that, if completed today, would make this day a success?"**

Everything else is noise.

### The Rules

1. **3-5 Tasks Daily** - No more, no less. Constraints breed focus.
2. **Countdown Timer** - Your waking hours are finite. Use them wisely.
3. **Morning Briefing** - Plan ahead. Review incomplete tasks each morning.
4. **Privacy First** - Your data stays on your device. No accounts, no tracking.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Inspired by the **Pareto Principle** (80/20 rule) and **Deep Work** by Cal Newport.

### The Signal

- Tasks that move you toward your goals
- High-impact, high-value work
- What you'll remember at the end of the year

### The Noise

- Busywork that feels productive but isn't
- Low-impact tasks that fill time
- What you'll forget by next week

**This app helps you amplify the signal and cut the noise.**

## 📖 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Set Your Schedule**
Configure your wake and sleep times in Settings. The app calculates your waking hours.

### 2️⃣ **Add Your Tasks**
Every morning (or the night before), add 3-5 mission-critical tasks.

### 3️⃣ **Work With Intent**
The countdown timer keeps you aware of your finite time. Focus Mode eliminates distractions.

### 4️⃣ **Review & Reflect**
At the end of the day, add session notes. Track your streaks and completion rate over time.

### 5️⃣ **Morning Briefing**
If you have incomplete tasks from yesterday, the app asks: **"Is this still Signal?"**
